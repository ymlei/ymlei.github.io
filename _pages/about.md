I'm a senior undergraduate student in Comuputer Science department at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn). I was fortunate to work with [Professor Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a research intern at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in the summer of 2020. I spent worderful half a year as an exchange student in [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris](https://en.isep.fr/) in Paris during 2019.

My research interests are in specialized processor and hardware/software interface. I believe specialized workloads need specialized processors.

Education
======
* Sep 2017 - Jun 2021(expected)<br>B.S.E. in Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China
* Sep 2019 - Feb 2020<br>Exchange Student at [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris](https://en.isep.fr/), Paris, France<br><br>

Resarch Experience
======

Digital Molecular Computer
------
Digital Molecular Computer was designed to solve large scale combination problems. It is inspired by molecular/DNA computer, combined massive parallelism of molecular computing and high speed of digital computer. Special microarchitecture and ISA were designed to achieve the delicated parallelism.<br>

Storage Core
------
To answer what storage processor we need? Profile current processors (ARM/RISC-V) in storage system with in-storage computation with gem-5.<br>
