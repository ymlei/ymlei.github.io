I'm a senior undergraduate student in Comuputer Science department at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications). I was fortunate to work with [Professor Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a research intern at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in the summer of 2020. I spent worderful half a year as an exchange student in [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris (ISEP)](https://en.isep.fr/) in Paris during 2019.

My research interests are mainly about computer architecture and system. Currently, I'm focusing on **specialized processor** and **data-centric computing**. I've done projects about designing processors for specialized problems and fields.

Education
======
* Sep 2017 - Jun 2021(expected)<br>B.S.E. in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications), Beijing, China
* Sep 2019 - Feb 2020<br>Exchange Student at [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris (ISEP)](https://en.isep.fr/), Paris, France<br><br>

Resarch Project
======

Digital Molecular Computer
------
Digital Molecular Computer (DMC) is created to solve large scale combination problems. Inspired by molecular/DNA computer, DMC combines massive parallelism of molecular computing and high speed of digital computer. Specialized microarchitecture and ISA are designed to achieve the well-organized parallelism.<br>
We implemented the DMC prototype in FPGA and processed variable-limited boolean satisfiability problems.

Storage Core
------
This project aims to answer what storage processor should be like. We profiled current storage processors (ARM/RISC-V) with in-storage computing workloads in gem-5.<br>
Currently, We are focusing SSD arrays managment system with FPGA.<br>
*In progress...*<br>
