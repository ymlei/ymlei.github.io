I'm a senior undergraduate student in Comuputer Science department at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications). I was fortunate to work with [Professor Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a research intern at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in the summer of 2020. I spent worderful half a year as an exchange student in [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris (ISEP)](https://en.isep.fr/) in Paris during 2019.

My research interests are mainly about computer architecture and system. Currently, I'm focusing on **specialized processor**, **hardware/software interface** and **in-storage computing**. I've done projects about designing processors for specialized problems and fields.

Education
======
* Sep 2017 - Jun 2021(expected)<br>B.S.E. in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications), Beijing, China
* Sep 2019 - Feb 2020<br>Exchange Student at [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris (ISEP)](https://en.isep.fr/), Paris, France<br><br>

Resarch Project
======

Digital Molecular Computer
------
Digital Molecular Computer was designed to solve large scale combination problems. It is inspired by molecular/DNA computer, combining massive parallelism of molecular computing and high speed of digital computer. Specialized microarchitecture and ISA were designed to achieve the well-organized parallelism.<br><br>

Storage Core
------
To answer what storage processor should be like. Profile current processors (ARM/RISC-V) in storage system with in-storage computing workloads with gem-5.<br>
