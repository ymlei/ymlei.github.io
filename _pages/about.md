I'm a senior undergraduate student in Comuputer Science department at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications). I was fortunate to work with [Professor Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a research intern at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in the summer of 2020. I spent worderful half a year as an exchange student in [Institut supérieur d’électronique de Paris (ISEP)](https://en.isep.fr/) in Paris during 2019.

My research interests are mainly about computer architecture and system, especially on the intersection between computation and storage. As the storage technique developed and massive data is created every day, the bottleneck appears between storage and computation nodes, not only because of hardware limitations, but the out-of-date computation models as well. My research aims to build efficiency systems by utilizing and hybridizing computation and storage from processor-level to datacenter-level. Currently, I'm focusing on **specialized processor** and **data-centric computing**.

What I have
* Strong general coding skill (CS Major)
* Hardware design and prototyping (FPGA)
* Simulator and Modeling (gem5)
* Project experience in Machine Learning (Keras)

Digital Molecular Computer
------
Digital Molecular Computer (DMC) is created to solve large scale combination problems. Inspired by molecular/DNA computer, DMC combines massive parallelism of molecular computing and high speed of digital computer. Specialized microarchitecture and ISA are designed to achieve the well-organized parallelism.<br>
We implemented the DMC prototype in FPGA and processed variable-limited boolean satisfiability problems.

In-Storage Computing
------
The idea of in-storage computing is moving the computation to storage device to reduce data movement. It benefits from IO reduction but hurts from computing weakness in SSD. We modeled that tradeoff with parameters of IO speed, processor capability, dispatch model and workload metrics. It provides a quantitative tool for analysis and guides us to develop dynamic workload dispatch systems in the future.<br>
Currently, We are focusing SSD arrays managment system with FPGA.<br>
